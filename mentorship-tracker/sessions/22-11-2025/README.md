# 🌀 Mentorship Evidence – 21 Nov 2025
**Session Type:** Robotics L1 – Centripetal Motion / Spinning Robot Build  
**Students:** 12  
**Location:** North London STEM Club  

## 📝 Summary  
Today’s robotics session focused on building robots that demonstrate centripetal/centrifugal motion through dual-motor rotation. Students experimented with wheel alignment, friction control, and stabilising rotational movement.

## 👨‍🏫 Mentoring Activity  
- Guided 3 students in balancing weight distribution  
- Helped 2 groups refine their spinning speeds  
- Corrected friction issues causing drift  
- Demonstrated safe rotation and stability techniques  

## 📊 Outcomes  
✔ 8 groups achieved stable circular rotation  
✔ 3 students created full 360° spinning bots  
✔ 1 “whirl spinner” concept prototype emerged  
✔ All students successfully tested rotational mechanics
